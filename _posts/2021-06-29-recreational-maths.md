Following are some bits of recreational or interesting math stuff I've come accross over the years. 

 * Tupper's self referential formula
 * Julia sets and the Mandelbrot fractal
 * Polygons, Polyhedrons and 4,5 Polytopes
 * Graham's number, TREE(3) and Rayo's number
 * Trancendental and Incomputable numbers
 * Fractional dimensions and fractals
 * Spikey spheres in higher dimensions
 * Pandigital numbers and formulas for e,pi
