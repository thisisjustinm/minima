Recreational mathematics is any type of mathematics mainly for entertainment rather than strictly for research stuff. Following are some bits of recreational or interesting math stuff I've come accross over the years. Most of the items come from Numberphile videos.

 * Fractional dimensions and fractals [[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)]
    * Exact self-similar:
      * Koch snowflake, Sierpinkski gasket, Menger sponge
