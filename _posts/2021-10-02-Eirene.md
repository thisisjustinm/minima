## Eirene
>Eirene is an application to capture and store upvotes/downvotes and display them in the form of a badge.

Named after the greek Goddess of peace.

For example, Eirene can be used as a like/dislike tracker for blogs made with Jekyll where the posts are written in Markdown. Strictly, it does not need to be used with Markdown, but can be used with HTML, RST etc. as well. Each badge consists of 3 parts, the upvote and downvote buttons, which are static,and the vote count badge, which displays dynamic changing vote count.

The service currently is just a PoC and does not have a persistent prod. db., but rather uses SQLITE. Since each dyno boots with a new copy in Heroku, anything stored in local db. will be deleted. This service will be properly running only after I move it to a prod. db.
