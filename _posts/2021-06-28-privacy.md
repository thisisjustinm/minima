It's always fun to post new pictures with the fancy filters on Instagram and updates about your life on Facebook. People like to know what's happening and other people like to tell their story. But what the people are unaware is the sheer amount of personal data they end up posting on the internet. It is astounding. And we know that anything on the internet, stays on the internet, FOREVER. 

What people normally don't realise is that they are giving up pieces of information about themselves, who they are, where they live etc. unknowingly all the time. A simple search on Google, can help find the bits and pieces of information that you've been giving away. Since most people like to use the same username over multiple sites, it is very easy to build a profile by connecting the pieces.
