This is a service to capture and store feedback and display them in the form of a badge (like shields). Initially named Eirene, after the godess of peace.

Named after the greek Goddess of divine law.

For example, it can be used as a like/dislike tracker for blogs made with Jekyll where the posts are written in Markdown. Strictly, it does not need to be used with Markdown, but can be used with HTML, RST etc. as well. Each badge consists of 3 parts, the upvote and downvote buttons, which are static, and the vote count badge, which displays dynamic changing vote count.

P.S.: The service currently is just a PoC and does not have a persistent prod. db., but rather uses H2. Since H2 gets rebooted each time I make any change, anything stored in local db. will be deleted. This service will be properly running only after I move it to a prod. db. I will add the deployment link here as soon as I deploy it to a proper provider with a persistent db.
