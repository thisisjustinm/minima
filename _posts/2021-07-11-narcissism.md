Narcissism is defined excessive interest in or admiration of oneself. Amongst the numbers too, exists, narcissitic numbers and self referential items, which identify themselves, and nothing else.

Following are the bit of narcisstic math stuff Iâ€™ve come accross over the years.

**Narcissistic number**: This is a number that is the sum of its digits raised to the number of digits in the number, in a given base. These numbers are more commonly known as Armstrong numbers. In base 10, 2 examples are 153 and 1634. OEIS ID: A005188
  * A 3 digit number: ```153 => 1^3 +  5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153```
  * A 4 digit number: ```1634 => 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634```

**13532385396179**: If we do the prime factorization of ```13532385396179```, we get the following product of primes, ```13 x 53^2 x 3853 x 96179```, which contains all the numbers in the original number. OEIS ID: A195264.

**Golomb's sequence**:  a(n) is the number of times n occurs, starting with a(1) = 1. Sequence is ```1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7,...```. If we create a sequence out of how many numbers appear at successive indices, we get back the Golomb's sequence. i.e. 1 appears 1 time, 2 appears 2 times, 3 appears 2 times, 4 appears 3 times, 5 appears 3 times, 6 appears 4 times and so on. If we keep track of how many times the appearences occur, we get ```1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4,...``` which is the Golomb's sequence.
