### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Justin M, a CSE graduate and I like to make stuff. 
I love solving problems with code, and often find myself quite bored if I don't have a project to work on. 
When I'm not coding, you can find me browsing YouTube or sleeping.

Things I love:
```
* ARGs
* CyberSec
* Cryptography
* Blockchain
* Fractals
* Puzzles
```
