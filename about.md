### Hello there!

My name is Justin M, a CSE graduate and I like to make stuff. 
I love solving problems with code, and often find myself bored if I don't have anything to work on. 
When I'm not doing that, you can find me browsing YouTube or sleeping.

My primary interests are Blockchain, Cyber Security, Mathematics, and Cryptography.
I also make puzzles and wierd services for fun.
